Roadmap
========

1. Connect to Cameras
Create models to interact with both cameras

2. Calibration
Write code to calibrate both cameras

3. collect dataset
collect dataset for both calibrated RGB-D cameras

4. implement U-Net
implement the first stage of the pipeline, the U-Net

5. train U-Net

6. implement LSTM

7 train LSTM
